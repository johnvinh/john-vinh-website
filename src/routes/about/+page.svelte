    Early On
</Subtitle>
<p>
I've been interested in building since I was a child. I started off following YouTube tutorials on how to make
basic websites with just HTML in the early 2010s.I followed up on my interest by learning Python while I was in high school. I used it to automate some
tedious tasks.

    I'm currently a student at Algonquin College in the Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science program.
    I recently learned I have a passion for making things for other people to have fun with and enjoy after watching
    the "Minecraft Championship" event on YouTube. I spend a lot of time developing Minecraft plugins.
