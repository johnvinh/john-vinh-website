            Early On

        <p>
            I've been interested in building since I was around 10 years old. I started off following YouTube tutorials
            on how to make basic websites with just HTML in the early 2010s. I followed up on my interest by learning
            Python while I was in high school using various sources like Codecademy and YouTube videos. I used Python
            to automate some tedious tasks and make scripts for some online browser games I play.

            In high school, I took a computer science class starting in grade 10. We used Visual Basic and
            ActionScript, some not-so-popular languages. I loved it and I ended up taking computer science classes
            in grade 11 and 12 as well. In each of these classes, I had a final project that involved working with
            3rd grade students and using their ideas and drawings to create a flash game with ActionScript. It was in
            these classes where my love for programming really started to grow.

            I'm currently a student at Algonquin College in the Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science program.
            I recently learned I have a passion for making things for other people to have fun with and enjoy after watching
            the "Minecraft Championship" event on YouTube. I'm hoping to get a job in the tech industry as a
            software developer after I graduate.
