            Early On

        <p>
            I've been interested in building since I was around 10 years old. I started following YouTube tutorials on making basic websites with just HTML in the early 2010s. I followed up on my interest by learning Python in high school using various sources like Codecademy and YouTube videos. I used Python to automate tedious tasks and make scripts for online browser games I play.

            I took a computer science class in high school starting in grade 10. We used Visual Basic and ActionScript, some not-so-popular languages. I loved it, and I also ended up taking computer science classes in grades 11 and 12. In each of these classes, I had a final project that involved working with 3rd-grade students and using their ideas and drawings to create a flash game with ActionScript. In these classes, my love for programming started to grow.

            I'm a student at Algonquin College in the Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science program. I recently learned I have a passion for making things for other people to have fun with and enjoy after watching the "Minecraft Championship" event on YouTube. After graduating, I plan to get a software developer job in the tech industry.
